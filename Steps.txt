1. Create a simple main menu that is going to call upon classes to function properly
2. From main menu, make subfunctions named Book, User, Author
3. Create class for each subfuction that preforms user selected tasks


4. Searching for a author, book, or member
    -user input either title, author, or member name
    -compare that user input and make sure it is found in the system
    -once found, pull that information and display it to the user

5. Adding a entry
    -create a list with other entries or empty
    -take user inputs for all the information we need
    -append that information to my initial list
    -print that it has been added





Questions to ask:
- is it best practice to set up my authors, books, and members as lists or dictionaries
    -That should answer the adding new entries (author, book, new member)
    -When it comes to searching for an entry, if a list use index and if it is a dictionaries what method is best?
    -I dont think indexing will work
